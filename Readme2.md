This repository contains a machine learning model designed to forecast future sales based on historical data and other external factors (e.g., promotions, seasonality, and regional performance). The primary goal of this model is to help businesses optimize inventory, plan marketing strategies, and forecast revenue more accurately.

Features:

	•	Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for ensemble predictions.
	•	Dataset Requirements: Time-series data with features like date, product category, sales volume, region, and promotional events.
	•	Performance Metrics: Evaluation is performed using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to ensure high predictive accuracy.
	•	Usage:
	1.	Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
	2.	Prepare the dataset in the required format (CSV/Excel).
	3.	Train the model using the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts.
	4.	Predict future sales by feeding the trained model with unseen data.

Files Included:

	•	train_model.py: Script to train the sales prediction model.
	•	predict_sales.py: Script to generate future sales predictions.
	•	data/: Folder containing sample datasets.
	•	notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and model building.
	•	README.md: Overview of the project.

Requirements:

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib

Feel free to modify this according to your project’s specifics!
